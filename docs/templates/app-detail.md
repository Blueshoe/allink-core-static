# App detail

The detail template of `App Plugin` content (e.g. `News`) can either be viewed in a [softpage](../modules/modals.md) (when navigating through the page) or as a `deeplink` (when calling the URL directly).

In both cases the exact same detail template is being used. The only difference is, that in a softpage only the content is displayed (header and footer are not included).

## Global styles for all app detail templates

As default we use a `col-1` layout altough it can be customised.
